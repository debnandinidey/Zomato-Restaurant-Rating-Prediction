# Zomato-Restaurant-Rating-Prediction
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting restaurant ratings on the popular food delivery platform Zomato.
The Zomato Restaurant Rating Prediction project is a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a restaurant based on various factors such as location, type of cuisine, cost for two people,online delivery option, book table option, and more. The model was trained on a dataset obtained from the popular restaurant discovery platform Zomato. Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression,Ridge and Lasso regression, Random Forest, Adaboost, and Gradient Boosting, were tested and the best performing model was selected. The model was then deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In addition, a web application was built using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input restaurant details and receive predicted ratings. The project's code and documentation can be found in this project's GitHub repository.
To access the deployed model you can go to the link  http://ec2-13-50-245-26.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080, although, please note that the AWS EC2 instance used for deployment has been terminated as of now to avoid any additional costs.I appreciate your understanding in this case.
